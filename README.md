# Email Filter Automation with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
To build a machine learning model to automatically categorize emails based on existing filters and patterns in your inbox. 

## Dataset
- **Size**: ~5000 emails across 3 inboxes
- **Features**: Subject, sender, content, date, existing filter labels
- **Goal**: Predict which filter/category an email should be assigned to

## Learning Objectives

### Phase 1: Data Understanding & Preprocessing
- [ ] Email data extraction and parsing
- [ ] Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- [ ] Feature engineering (TF-IDF, word embeddings)
- [ ] Data visualization and exploration

### Phase 2: Model Development
- [ ] Implement baseline models (Naive Bayes, SVM)
- [ ] Build neural network classifier
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Model comparison and selection

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Deployment
- [ ] Cross-validation strategies
- [ ] Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- [ ] Model interpretation and feature importance
- [ ] Deployment considerations

### Installation
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv email_ml_env
source email_ml_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: email_ml_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: >85% on test set
- **Precision/Recall**: Balanced performance across categories
- **Learning**: Understanding of each ML concept implemented

## Development Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Extract emails from your inboxes
2. **Exploration**: Understand data patterns and distributions
3. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for ML
4. **Baseline**: Start with simple models
5. **Iterate**: Improve based on results
6. **Evaluate**: Measure and document performance

## Advanced Features (Future)
- Filter recommendation system
- Email priority scoring
- Spam detection integration
- Real-time classification API

# Email Filter Automation with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
To build a machine learning model to automatically categorize emails based on existing filters and patterns in your inbox. 

## Dataset
- **Size**: ~5000 emails across 3 inboxes
- **Features**: Subject, sender, content, date, existing filter labels
- **Goal**: Predict which filter/category an email should be assigned to
